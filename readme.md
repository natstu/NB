# NEVERBLAND Coding Challenge

We built a prototype of an application that let the user search for a movie and get some information about it. This application has to be simple but can potentially scale as a mid-range project in the future.

We just received the design from the graphic designer and it needs to be implemented.

How would you refactor this application using your own methods and workflow?
- Angular, Gulp/node modules

How would you implement the design?
- SASS, Bootstrap, flexbox, wow.js, animation.css, font awesome from CDN

No result text:
<span class="no-results">
 No Cigar :'-(
</span>


The features of the app:
- Search for movies using the API http://www.omdbapi.com/
- Display a list of results
- Sort the results
- Let the user click and have more informations about a movie

We just want to have a taste of your way of working with design and code!

Happy coding!
